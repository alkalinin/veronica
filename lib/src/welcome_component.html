        Why this site has name &quot;Veronica Roma&quot;? &quot;Veronica&quot; is the one of the most popular
        specie of the &quot;Romanesco broccoli&quot;. Romanesco has a striking appearance because its form is a natural
        approximation of a fractal. Here we study the &quot;Mentalization&quot; theory. Or thinking about thining. That
        is also a form of fractal process.

        In psychology, mentalization is the ability to understand the mental state, of oneself or others, that
        underlies overt behaviour. Mentalization can be seen as a form of imaginative mental activity that lets us
        perceive and interpret human behaviour in terms of intentional mental states (e.g., needs, desires, feelings,
        beliefs, goals, purposes, and reasons). It is sometimes described as "understanding misunderstanding."
        Another term that David Wallin has used for mentalization is "Thinking about thinking". Mentalization can
        occur either automatically or consciously. Mentalization ability, or mentalizing, is weakened by intense
        emotion.

        Mentalization has implications for attachment theory and self-development. According to Peter Fonagy,
        individuals with disorganized attachment style (e.g., due to physical, psychological, or sexual abuse), can
        have greater difficulty developing the ability to mentalize. Attachment history partially determines the
        strength of mentalizing capacity of individuals. Securely-attached individuals tend to have had a primary
        caregiver that has more complex and sophisticated mentalizing abilities. As a consequence, these children
        possess more robust capacities to represent the states of their own and other peopleâ€™s minds. Early childhood
        exposure to mentalization can protect the individual from psychosocial adversity. This theory needs
        further empirical support.
